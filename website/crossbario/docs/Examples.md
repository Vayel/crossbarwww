## Working code is the best documentation

Working code is in itself proof that what you see is not outdated, doesn't have any typos, or suffers from any other problems that written documentation may have. 

We provide code examples for various features of Crossbar.io in the [ examples repository](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarexamples). It's always a good idea to check this when you run into any problems


## Using the examples

The examples are self-contained and ready to run. Each of the example directories contains an Crossbar.io configuration. In order to run the example, just got to its directory and do `crossbar start`.


## Adapting for other languages

Most of the examples are for Python and JavaScript, even though often what is shown would work with other languages and WAMP client libraries. This is purely due to lack of resources. We want you to use Crossbar.io with whatever language or languages you want.

Anybody's highly welcome to adapt example code for other languages.

Similarly, you're welcome to add examples that you think provide value to other users.

## Keeping things up to date

As you'll probably notice sooner or later, Crossbar.io is a work in progress. Core functionality is stable, but there is a lot of development going on around it. We try to keep these examples working. If you find that something is broken, then please file an issue (or fix it and send us a pull request).
