# Crossbar.io Web Site

This repository contains the [Crossbar.io Web Site](http://crossbar.io/).

## Testing locally

Run

```
make test
```

You will need a couple of tools installed:

* Inkscape
* SCons
* Taschenmesser
* Sphinx
* ..

Some of them can be installed by running

```
make requirements
```

And you will also need to have a working copy of the [Crossbar.io Wiki](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/wiki) repository as a sibling directory to this directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:crossbario/crossbar.wiki.git
```
